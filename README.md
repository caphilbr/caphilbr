### Allowance & Chore Tracker
![Public Website](https://allowance-chore-tracker-46cd68f48ad0.herokuapp.com/)<br/>
![Repo](https://github.com/caphilbr/allowance-chore-tracker)<br/>
A web app to make family chore tracking and allowance payments easy. Once a parent creates a "family", they send an invite to their children to join via their own user accounts. As a parent, they can setup recurring allowance payments and create & assign chores to children. Each chore has a due date and a dollar value. As a child, they can see their balance and assigned chores. Once a chore is completed, they submit to their parent for approval and payment.

Other notable features include the use of a one-time invite code to invite a child, uploading of profile photos, automatic allowance payments, parental ability to make ad hoc adjustments to child balances, a graphical presentation of a child's balance over time, and a weekly quiz to earn additional money.

The app was built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL (with Knex & Objection). Other technical solutions include Nodemailer for sending email invites, Dropbox for profile photos, Passport for user authentication, D3 for charts, and a 3rd party API for the quiz.<br/><br/>
